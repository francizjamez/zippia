Hi Francis,

Thanks for doing the test. It seems like you have done well, and so we are interested to move forward to the next step. Please see below for the next test project. We look forward to your completed project. You can submit the results directly here on Upwork.

Goal:
Creating a simple web website to show some jobs from API.
Technologies:
Required: Node.js, React
Nice to have: Next.js, Server Side Rendering
Details:
* Create a website with Node.js, this website just needs one page, URL: /test/jobs/
* On this page, connect to an API service URL where you will get a json with a list of jobs https://www.zippia.com/api/jobs/ with following parameters:
POST https://www.zippia.com/api/jobs/
Request payload:
{
"companySkills": true,
"dismissedListingHashes": [],
"fetchJobDesc": true,
"jobTitle": "Business Analyst",
"locations": [],
"numJobs": 20,
"previousListingHashes": []
}
* List the first 10 jobs with cards, you should display the job title (jobTitle), the job company (companyName), and the job description (shortDesc).
* Add a button that will offer to search the jobs by company names.
* Add a button that will display/filter only the jobs published in the last 7 days.
* Display the jobs as a list or as a carousel (slider).
* Try to add some styles to the elements of the jobs.
* Try to make it responsive (supports desktops, mobile phones and tablets).
* If possible, please do SSR (Server Side Rendering) for the first screen.
* Try to add as many comments as you could explaining your code.
* You can use common frameworks as necessary.
* This should take no longer than 4 hours to do
* You have 48 hours to return your code to this email, doing as much as you can.
* Please deploy your code to https://vercel.com/, and then send the page URL to us.
* Please also send your code to us.
* If you are busy and don't have enough time please contact me and we can postpone the test to another moment.
* If you have any questions feel free to ask.
* You can take as design reference: https://www.zippia.com/developer-jobs/jobs/
